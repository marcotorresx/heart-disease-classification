# Heart Disease Classification

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their recorded conditions.

### Steps

The approach for achieving this goal will involve the following steps:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Features
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation

Three different models were tested: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest. A Grid Search was performed to find the best parameters for each model in order to try to maximize the results. In the end, the best results were obtained with the Logistic Regression model.
